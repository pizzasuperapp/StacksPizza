# Stacks Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

This directory formerly contained all of the in-progress Stacks Improvement Proposals before the Stacks 2.0 mainnet launched.

The SIPs are now located in the [stacksgov/sips repository](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips) as part of the [Stacks Community Governance organization](https://github.com/stacksgov).
